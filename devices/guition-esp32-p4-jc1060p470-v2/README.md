# Guition ESP32-P4 JC1060P470 V2 / new panel (7")

7-inch 1024x600 touchscreen panel that runs EspControl firmware for Home Assistant. A fixed 3x5 grid of 15 configurable buttons lets you control lights, switches, fans, and other smart home devices with a single tap. The display also shows a live clock, indoor/outdoor temperature, and includes a screensaver with adjustable brightness.

After the initial install, everything is configured through the built-in web page — no coding or file editing required.

## Which panel is this?

Guition ships two 7-inch panels under the same JC1060P470 name. This profile is for the
V2 panel, whose case is marked `V2`. V1 / original cases have no version marking at all—they
do not say `V1`. If needed, disconnect the panel from power and remove the back: a date code
of `2622` or higher on the screen's circuit board identifies V2; an earlier code identifies
V1 and needs the original [JC1060P470 profile](../guition-esp32-p4-jc1060p470/). Flashing
the wrong one leaves a white screen with a vertical noise band; reflash the other profile
to recover.
