# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help improve EspControl.

The project has a developer guide for people who want to work on the firmware,
the web configurator, docs, or generated files:

[Read the EspControl developer reference on GitHub](https://github.com/tiomny/espcontrol/blob/main/dev-docs/README.md)

Those pages cover the project layout, local build tools, how the web
configurator is bundled, how to flash a development build, where logs come from,
and what needs to change when adding or fixing a card type.

## Before Opening a Pull Request

- Check the existing [issues](https://github.com/tiomny/espcontrol/issues)
  to see if the change is already being discussed.
- Keep the change focused so it is easier to test.
- Run the checks listed in the developer reference before submitting code
  changes.
- If your change affects how users configure or use the panel, update the docs
  in this site too.

For small fixes, a pull request is usually enough. For larger changes, especially
new card types or firmware behaviour, opening an issue first makes it easier to
agree what should change before you spend time building it.

## Pull Request Testing

Pull requests should make the next step obvious. The PR template asks for the
practical impact, documentation decision, testing status, and whether a physical
device test is needed before merge.

When a pull request changes firmware, device configuration, shared display
files, or web files used by the device, an automated workflow posts suggested
device testing notes. Treat those notes as the starting point for manual device
testing after the automated checks pass.

A successful compile or CI run confirms that the project builds. It does not
replace testing on the affected display when the change touches the on-device
experience.
