# Language Support

Most of the text shown by EspControl comes directly from Home Assistant. Entity names, states, media titles, weather values, service names, and other Home Assistant content are shown using the text Home Assistant provides. If Home Assistant has translated that content for your language, EspControl will normally show that translated text too.

EspControl only keeps its own translations for text that is built into the screen firmware, such as fixed button labels, status messages, weather labels, month names, and confirmation prompts.

The source list for that built-in screen text is the [English strings file](https://github.com/tiomny/espcontrol/blob/main/product/v2/translations/strings.en.txt). Each supported language has a matching file in the same folder.

## Webserver Translation

Translating the built-in webserver is out of scope. The webserver is a setup and configuration tool rather than the main user-facing screen experience, so translation work is focused on the display itself.

## Report a Mistranslation

If you find text on the screen that is translated incorrectly, please [raise a GitHub issue](https://github.com/tiomny/espcontrol/issues/new) and include:

- the language you are using
- the current text shown on the screen
- the corrected translation
- where you saw it, if that helps identify the text

If you are comfortable making the change yourself, you can also open a pull request. Use the [English strings file](https://github.com/tiomny/espcontrol/blob/main/product/v2/translations/strings.en.txt) as the reference and edit only the translated text after each `=`.

## Request a New Language

If you want EspControl to support another language, please [raise a GitHub issue](https://github.com/tiomny/espcontrol/issues/new). Ideally, include the translated content as part of the request, using the [English strings file](https://github.com/tiomny/espcontrol/blob/main/product/v2/translations/strings.en.txt) as the source.

New languages are much easier to add when a fluent speaker can provide or review the translations. Some languages may also need extra font characters before they can display correctly on the screen.
